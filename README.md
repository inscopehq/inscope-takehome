# Overview

In this assignment you will build an interactive bank administrator interface, where a clerk can find information about the bank's clients and their accounts. The clerk can also inquire on eligibility for new loans on behalf of a client by hitting an underwriting service with the required information.


# Instructions
1. Clone (**please, don't fork!**) this repository and create a new branch for your development work
1. Create your implementation following the [Specification](#specification) below
1. Add instructions on how to run your implementation to the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.
1. In the [follow-up questions](#follow-up-questions) section below, respond inline to each of the questions.
1. Commit your implementation and answers to a new private repo in your personal GH and give `@avyfain` access to the repo.

**Guidelines:**
- Do not spend longer than two hours on your implementation, a perfect implementation is not required or expected. Please move on to the [follow-up questions](#follow-up-questions) after that.
- You may use any libraries or frameworks of your choosing (e.g. React, Svelte, etc.)
- The visual design of the components is not super important. Feel free to use an existing component framework (e.g. Material Design, Bootstrap, etc.) or design your own.


# Specification

You will build the following functionality:
  - [ ] Load clients from the provided endpoint (See [Exercise Data](#exercise-data))
  - [ ] Display the clients in a 3 column grid, showing their name and the date they opened their account.
  - [ ] A client's balance is calculated as the sum of all transactions since their last statement, plus their starting balance.
  - [ ] When a user clicks on a client, toggle a visual "selected" state to indicate it has been selected, and show their current balance.
  - [ ] When the "Check loan eligibility" button is pressed, send a POST request with the selected client's information to the underwriting service (See [Underwriting Service](#underwriting))
  - [ ] If the client is eligible for a loan, display a message indicating the loan amounts and rates available.
  - [ ] If the client is not eligible, display a message indicating they were declined.

## Exercise Data

The client list can be loaded by making an HTTP request to the following URL:
- `https://inscope-takehome-service.onrender.com/clients`

Notice that this server runs on a free-tier Render account, so it might be slow to wake up on your first request.


The JSON response is structured as follows:
```js
{
  "count": 1,                     // the number of items in the collection
  "next": "",                     // the url to follow for the next page
  "previous": "",                 // the url to follow for the previous page
  "results": [                    // a list of Client objects
    {"id": "",                    // the unique identifier for this client
     "first_name": "",            // the client's first name
     "last_name": "",             // the client's last name
     "client_since": "",          // timestamp the client joined the bank
     "previous_period_balance": 1 // the client's last balance, in cents
     },
     ...
    ]
}

````


The client transactions since the last statement can be loaded by making an HTTP request to the following URL:

- `https://inscope-takehome-service.onrender.com/clients/<client_id>/transactions`

The JSON response is structured as follows:

```js
{
  "count": 1,         // the number of items in the collection
  "next": "",         // the url to follow for the next page
  "previous": "",     // the url to follow for the previous page
  "results": [        // a list of Client objects
    {"id": "",        // the unique identifier for this transaction
     "detail": "",    // a note about the transaction's origin
     "amount": "",    // the transaction amount, in cents
     "timestamp": "", // timestamp when the transaction occurred
     },
     ...
    ]
}
```

## Underwriting

A server-side underwriting service is available at the following url:
`https://inscope-takehome-service.onrender.com/underwrite`


To check a client's eligibility, create a POST request where the body contains a JSON object with the keys:

- `current_balance` with the balance in cents calculated above
- `num_transactions` with the number of transactions in the current period
- `client_since`, with a date formatted `YYYY/MM/DD`

For example, a client with a balance of $123.45, with 3 in-period transactions who joined the bank on December 1st 2021 we'd send a request as defined in the JSON object below:

**Request Body**
```js
{
  "current_balance": 12345,
  "previous_period_balance": 6789,
  "num_transactions": 3,
  "client_since": "2021/12/01"
}
```

**Response**
```js
{
  "eligible": true,  // boolean indicating eligibility for this client
  "amount": 50000,   // loan amount, in cents, in this case quivalent to $500.00
  "bp_rate": 325     // annual rate percentage in basis points, in this case equivalent to 3.25%
  "reason": null
}
```

# Getting Started

This is a placeholder for instructions on how to run your implementation.

# Follow-Up Questions

  1. Describe which task you found most difficult in the implementation, and why.
  1. What lead you to choose these libraries or frameworks you used in your implementation?
  1. If there were no time restrictions for this exercise, what improvements would you make in the following areas:
      - Implementation
      - User Experience
      - Accessibility
  1. If you were asked to refactor this exercise so it could be display historical data, what changes would you make?
  1. Assume you are provided with a unique identifier for loan application submitted by the clerks. You are tasked with storing requests in persistent storage so bank managers can track patterns in loan applications. Give a high level overview of how you would implement this feature.
